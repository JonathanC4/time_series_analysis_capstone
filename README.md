# Capstone-Time-Series-Analysis

## Problem Statement
How effective is time series modeling? In this project, I explore basic ARIMA techniques and apply them to Tesla's stock prices with both exogenous and endogenous variables. In addition, I've constructed a rudimentary Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to contrast performance (forecasting error) between the two models.

## Purpose
The primary focus of this project is the time series analysis methodology. I did not bring into consideration other factors that may have affected Tesla's stock price movement. Topics covered include:
  - Autocorrelation and Partial AC
  - Non-seasonal ARIMA models (p, d, q)
  - Time series deconstruction: trend, seasonality and white noise
  - Stationarity
  - LSTM RNN
